**Parent:** [Project Design](../PROJECT_DESIGN.md)

## Overview

This final phase focuses on creating comprehensive guidelines and documentation based on all previous phases. The goal is to provide practical resources for the development community on modern software project organization and best practices.

## Phase 5 Purpose
**Goal**: Create comprehensive guidelines and documentation for the development community

## What Phase 5 Does
1. **Guideline Creation** - Comprehensive guidelines and best practices
2. **Documentation** - Final documentation and recommendations

## What Phase 5 Does NOT Do
- Pattern discovery (that's Phase 3)
- Template creation (that's Phase 4)
- Individual repository analysis (that's Phase 2)

## Key Activities

### 1. Guideline Creation
- **Universal Practices**: Guidelines applicable across all project types
- **Category-Specific Guidelines**: Tailored recommendations for each project type
- **Scale Guidelines**: How to adapt practices as projects grow
- **Tool Recommendations**: Curated lists of recommended tools and configurations

### 2. Documentation
- **Best Practice Guides**: Comprehensive guides on best practices
- **Implementation Guides**: How to implement discovered practices
- **Tool Guides**: Guides for recommended tools and configurations
- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples of best practices in action
