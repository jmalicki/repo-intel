# Phase 1: Detailed Candidate Identification Plan

**Parent:** [Project Design](../../PROJECT_DESIGN.md)
**Related:** [Project Selection Methodology](PROJECT_SELECTION_METHODOLOGY.md) - High-level selection approach

## Overview

This document provides specific implementation details for identifying candidate projects across all 8 categories using multiple discovery methods. This is the **detailed execution plan** that implements the high-level methodology described in PROJECT_SELECTION_METHODOLOGY.md.

**Relationship to PROJECT_SELECTION_METHODOLOGY.md:**
- **PROJECT_SELECTION_METHODOLOGY.md**: High-level strategy, criteria, and timeline
- **CANDIDATE_IDENTIFICATION_PLAN.md**: Detailed implementation steps and specific queries
- **AUTOMATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md**: Which tasks can be automated vs. require human judgment

## Method 1: Knowledge-Based Selection

### Training Data Mining
**Implementation:**
- Query knowledge base for "best practices" projects in each category
- Search for projects mentioned in architectural discussions
- Identify projects from "awesome lists" and curated collections
- Reference projects from educational materials and tutorials

**Specific Queries to Execute:**
- "What are the most well-regarded Chrome extensions for developers?"
- "Which Rust libraries are considered best-in-class for performance?"
- "What are the most popular MCP server implementations?"
- "Which full-stack frameworks are known for their architecture?"
- "What are the most respected data science libraries?"
- "Which CLI tools are considered gold standards?"
- "What mobile app frameworks are most recommended?"
- "Which documentation platforms are most praised?"

**Expected Output:** 5-10 candidates per category from knowledge base

### Community Recognition
**Implementation:**
- Search for projects mentioned in "best practices" discussions
- Identify projects from Stack Overflow "most loved" technologies
- Reference projects from developer surveys and reports
- Find projects mentioned in conference talks and presentations

**Specific Sources:**
- Stack Overflow Developer Survey results
- State of JS, State of CSS, State of Rust surveys
- GitHub's "Trending" and "Most Starred" lists
- Conference talk abstracts and slides
- Blog posts about "best practices" and "architecture"

**Expected Output:** 3-5 additional candidates per category

## Method 2: Search-Based Discovery

### GitHub Trending Analysis
**Implementation:**
- Use GitHub API to query trending repositories by language/topic
- Filter by category-specific topics and tags
- Analyze trending over different time periods (weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Cross-reference with star growth rates

**Specific GitHub Searches:**
```
# Chrome Extensions
topic:chrome-extension
topic:browser-extension
language:JavaScript topic:extension

# MCP Servers  
topic:mcp-server
topic:model-context-protocol
language:Python topic:mcp

```

**Expected Output:** 10-15 candidates per category

### Star Count Analysis
**Implementation:**
- Query GitHub API for repositories sorted by star count
- Filter by category-specific criteria
- Analyze star-to-fork ratios for community engagement
- Cross-reference with recent activity

**API Queries:**
```bash
# Example GitHub API calls
curl "https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=language:rust+stars:>1000&sort=stars&order=desc"
curl "https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=topic:chrome-extension+stars:>500&sort=stars&order=desc"
```

**Expected Output:** 5-8 candidates per category

### Fork Analysis
**Implementation:**
- Analyze fork-to-star ratios to identify community adoption
- Look for projects with high fork counts relative to stars
- Identify projects with active fork communities
- Cross-reference with recent fork activity

**Metrics to Calculate:**
- Fork-to-star ratio
- Recent fork activity (last 6 months)
- Fork engagement (issues, PRs from forks)
- Fork maintenance (active forks vs. stale forks)

**Expected Output:** 3-5 candidates per category

## Method 3: Community-Based Research

### Developer Survey Analysis
**Implementation:**
- Analyze Stack Overflow Developer Survey results
- Reference State of JS, State of CSS, State of Rust surveys
