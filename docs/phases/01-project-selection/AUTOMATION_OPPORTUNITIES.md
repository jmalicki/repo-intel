### 5. Documentation Completeness Analysis
**Current Process:** Manual review of documentation quality
**Automation Potential:** 60% - Partially automatable (LLM needed for pattern matching)
**Implementation:**
- Script to analyze repository structure for documentation files
- Automated detection of documentation completeness
- Analysis of documentation update frequency
- Generation of documentation quality scores

**Script Responsibilities (No LLM needed):**
- Detect presence of README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE files
- Count documentation file types and sizes
- Check for presence of API documentation, tutorials, examples
- Calculate documentation update frequency
- Generate documentation completeness scores

**LLM Responsibilities (Pattern matching requires judgment):**
- Pattern matching for documentation-related keywords in filenames
- Content analysis for documentation-related terms in file contents
- Detection of unexpected documentation structures
- Identification of novel documentation practices

**Human Role:** Review documentation completeness assessment, not individual file analysis

## Partially Automatable Tasks

### 6. Community Health Metrics
**Current Process:** Manual analysis of community engagement
**Automation Potential:** 70% - Partially automatable (LLM needed for pattern matching)
**Implementation:**
- Script to analyze issue/PR response times
- Automated calculation of community engagement metrics
- Analysis of contributor diversity and activity
- Generation of community health reports

**Script Responsibilities (No LLM needed):**
- Calculate issue/PR response times and resolution rates
- Count contributor activity and diversity metrics
- Calculate community engagement metrics (comments, reactions, participation)
- Generate community health scores based on quantitative data
- Identify community health patterns in the data

**LLM Responsibilities (Pattern matching requires judgment):**
- Pattern matching for community-related keywords in filenames
- Content analysis for community-related terms in file contents
- Detection of unexpected community practices
- Identification of novel community engagement patterns

**Human Role:** Review community health assessment, not individual metric calculations

### 7. Security Practice Detection
**Current Process:** Manual review of security practices
**Automation Potential:** 60% - Partially automatable (LLM needed for pattern matching)
**Implementation:**
- Script to detect security-related files and configurations
- Automated analysis of dependency scanning setup
- Detection of security documentation and policies
- Generation of security practice reports

**Script Responsibilities (No LLM needed):**
- Detect presence of specific security files (SECURITY.md, .github/security.yml, .github/dependabot.yml)
- Count security-related file occurrences
- Detect presence of dependency scanning tools (dependabot, renovate, snyk configs)
- Count security-related GitHub Actions workflows
- Generate security file presence reports

**LLM Responsibilities (Pattern matching requires judgment):**
- Pattern matching for security-related keywords in filenames
- Content analysis for security-related terms in file contents
- Detection of unexpected security configurations
- Identification of novel security practices

**Human Role:** Review security file presence assessment, not individual file detection

## Low Automation Potential (Human Judgment Required)

### 8. Code Quality Assessment
**Current Process:** Manual code review and quality analysis
**Automation Potential:** 20% - Low automation potential
**Human Role:** Essential for code quality judgment
**Reasoning:** Code quality requires architectural understanding, design pattern recognition, and subjective quality assessment

### 9. Community Culture Analysis
**Current Process:** Manual analysis of community dynamics and culture
**Automation Potential:** 10% - Very low automation potential
**Human Role:** Essential for community culture assessment
**Reasoning:** Community culture requires understanding of communication patterns, governance models, and social dynamics

### 10. Innovation and Best Practice Identification
**Current Process:** Manual identification of innovative practices
**Automation Potential:** 5% - Minimal automation potential
**Human Role:** Essential for innovation assessment
**Reasoning:** Innovation requires understanding of industry context, creative problem-solving, and best practice recognition

## Expected Token Savings

**Before Automation:** ~50,000 tokens for manual data collection and analysis
**After Automation:** ~15,000 tokens for review and judgment
**Token Savings:** ~70% reduction in token usage
**Focus Shift:** From mechanistic data collection to high-value judgment tasks

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Impact, Low Effort:** GitHub API data collection, quantitative metrics
2. **High Impact, Medium Effort:** Trending analysis, package manager data
3. **Medium Impact, Low Effort:** Documentation analysis, community health metrics
4. **Low Impact, High Effort:** Security practice detection, code quality analysis

This automation strategy maximizes token efficiency while preserving human judgment for the most critical evaluation tasks.
