# Phase 1 Tool Design Overview

**Navigation:** [Project Selection](../phases/01-project-selection/AUTOMATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md) → Projects Overview

This directory contains the detailed design specifications for tools needed to support Phase 1 (Project Selection) of the repo intelligence project.

## Tool Architecture

The Phase 1 tools are designed to automate candidate identification while minimizing token usage and maximizing human judgment on high-value tasks.

## Tool Categories

### 1. Data Collection Tools
- **GitHub API Collector** - Automated GitHub API data collection
- **Package Manager Collector** - NPM, PyPI, crates.io data collection
- **Trending Analyzer** - GitHub trending repository analysis

### 2. Analysis Tools
- **Metrics Calculator** - Quantitative metrics calculation and scoring
- **Pattern Matcher** - LLM-based pattern matching and discovery
- **Report Generator** - Automated report generation and formatting

### 3. Orchestration Tools
- **Workflow Orchestrator** - End-to-end automation coordination
- **Data Aggregator** - Multi-source data integration
- **Quality Filter** - Automated filtering and threshold application

## Design Principles

1. **Maximize Automation** - Use scripts for mechanistic tasks
2. **Minimize LLM Usage** - Only use LLMs where judgment is required
3. **Preserve Human Review** - Focus human intelligence on high-value assessment
4. **Token Efficiency** - Reduce token usage by 70% through automation
5. **Scalability** - Handle 160-240 candidate projects efficiently

## Tool Integration

Each tool is designed to work independently while integrating seamlessly with the overall workflow:

```
Data Collection → Analysis → Pattern Matching → Report Generation → Human Review
```
