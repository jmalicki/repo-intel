# Phase 1: Project Selection Tools

**Navigation:** [Projects Overview](../README.md) → [Project Selection](../../01-project-selection/AUTOMATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md) → Phase 1 Tools

This directory contains tools for **selecting** which projects to analyze, not for analyzing them.

## Phase 1 Purpose
**Goal**: Choose a high-quality, diverse set of projects for rigorous analysis

## What Phase 1 Does
1. **Identify candidate projects** across 8 categories
2. **Apply initial filters** (stars, activity, quality indicators)
3. **Generate shortlist** of projects worth deep analysis
4. **Provide selection rationale** for each chosen project

## What Phase 1 Does NOT Do
- Deep repository analysis
- Pattern discovery
- Best practice identification
- Template generation

## Tools Needed for Phase 1

### 1. Project Discovery Tools
- **GitHub API Collector** - Find projects by category, stars, activity
- **Package Manager Collector** - Find projects by download stats
- **Trending Analyzer** - Find trending and emerging projects

### 2. Initial Filtering Tools
- **Metrics Calculator** - Calculate basic quality metrics
- **Quality Filter** - Apply minimum thresholds
- **Data Aggregator** - Combine data from multiple sources

### 3. Selection Tools
- **Report Generator** - Generate selection reports
- **Selection Rationale** - Document why projects were chosen

## Output of Phase 1
- **Shortlist of 24-40 projects** (3-5 per category)
- **Selection rationale** for each project
- **Quality metrics** for each project
- **Diversity analysis** across categories and scales

## Next Phase
Phase 1 feeds into **Phase 2: Analysis** where we do the deep repository analysis and pattern discovery.
