3. **Phase 3** → `main` (Storage)
4. **Phase 4** → `main` (Metrics)
5. **Phase 5** → `main` (Validation)
6. **Phase 6** → `main` (Integration)

### Post-Merge Actions
- [ ] Update main branch documentation
- [ ] Create release tags for each phase
- [ ] Update project README with usage examples
- [ ] Create migration guide for existing code
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines for new library

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **Formatting**: Always run `cargo fmt` before committing
- **Linting**: Always run `cargo clippy` before committing
- **Testing**: Maintain >90% test coverage
- **Documentation**: All public APIs must be documented
- **Performance**: Include benchmarks for performance-critical code

### Branch Management
- **Naming**: Use `feat/` prefix for feature branches
- **Stacking**: Each phase builds on the previous phase
- **Rebasing**: Rebase on main before creating PRs
- **Squashing**: Squash commits before merging to main

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical operations
- **Mock Tests**: Use mocks for external dependencies
- **Documentation Tests**: Ensure examples compile and run

### Review Process
- **Self Review**: Review your own code before creating PR
- **Peer Review**: Get at least one peer review before merging
- **Automated Checks**: Ensure all CI checks pass
- **Performance Review**: Review performance implications
- **Security Review**: Review security implications
