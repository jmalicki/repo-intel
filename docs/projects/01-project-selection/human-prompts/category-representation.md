## Assessment Criteria

### Representation Quality
- [ ] Each category has appropriate scale diversity
- [ ] Each category has approach diversity
- [ ] Each category has community diversity
- [ ] Overall project set is balanced

### Coverage Completeness
- [ ] All major patterns within categories are represented
- [ ] All major technology stacks are covered
- [ ] All major organizational models are included
- [ ] No significant gaps in representation

### Quality Balance
- [ ] High-quality projects across all scales
- [ ] Excellence examples in each approach
- [ ] Best practices represented across diversity
- [ ] Innovation examples included

## Decision Framework

### 1. Gap Analysis
- Identify missing patterns or approaches
- Find underrepresented scales or communities
- Locate technology stack gaps
- Assess organizational model coverage

### 2. Replacement Strategy
- Identify projects that could be replaced
- Find better examples of underrepresented patterns
- Balance quality with diversity requirements
- Maintain overall quality standards

### 3. Final Validation
- Ensure all diversity requirements are met
- Validate quality across all dimensions
- Confirm category-specific requirements
- Document representation rationale

## Documentation Requirements

### Representation Summary
