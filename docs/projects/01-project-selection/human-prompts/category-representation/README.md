# Category Representation

**Parent:** [Human Prompts](../README.md)
**Related:** [Automation Opportunities](../../../phases/01-project-selection/AUTOMATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md) - Category Representation task

## Overview

This directory contains discrete prompts for ensuring appropriate category coverage and diversity. Each prompt focuses on a specific aspect of representation assessment.

## Discrete Prompts

### 1. [Scale Diversity](scale-diversity.md)
**Purpose:** Assess scale diversity across project categories
**Focus:** Small, medium, and large project representation
**Output:** Scale distribution analysis and recommendations

### 2. [Approach Diversity](approach-diversity.md)
**Purpose:** Assess approach diversity across project categories
**Focus:** Architectural patterns, technology stacks, organizational models
**Output:** Approach diversity analysis and recommendations

### 3. [Community Diversity](community-diversity.md)
**Purpose:** Assess community diversity across project categories
**Focus:** Community sizes, governance models, contribution patterns
**Output:** Community diversity analysis and recommendations

## Usage Workflow

### Step 1: Scale Diversity Assessment
- Use [scale-diversity.md](scale-diversity.md) to assess project scale representation
- Ensure small, medium, and large projects are represented
- Document scale distribution and gaps

### Step 2: Approach Diversity Assessment
- Use [approach-diversity.md](approach-diversity.md) to assess approach representation
- Ensure architectural, technology, and organizational diversity
- Document approach distribution and gaps

### Step 3: Community Diversity Assessment
- Use [community-diversity.md](community-diversity.md) to assess community representation
- Ensure community size, governance, and contribution diversity
- Document community distribution and gaps

## Expected Outcomes

- **Comprehensive Scale Representation**: Appropriate distribution of small, medium, and large projects
- **Diverse Approaches**: Representation of different architectural patterns and technology stacks
- **Community Diversity**: Representation of different community sizes and governance models
- **Quality Balance**: High-quality projects across all diversity dimensions

## Quality Assurance

### Cross-Category Validation
- [ ] Patterns are represented across categories
- [ ] Approaches are balanced within categories
- [ ] Quality is maintained across diversity
- [ ] Innovation is represented appropriately

### Category-Specific Validation
- [ ] Each category meets specific requirements
- [ ] Category-specific patterns are represented
- [ ] Technology stacks are appropriate
- [ ] Community models are diverse

### Overall Balance Validation
- [ ] No single approach dominates
- [ ] Quality is distributed across diversity
- [ ] Innovation is represented appropriately
- [ ] Best practices are well-distributed

This approach ensures comprehensive category representation while maintaining quality standards and enabling meaningful cross-project analysis.
