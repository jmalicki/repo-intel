# Scale Diversity Assessment

**Parent:** [Category Representation](README.md)

## Overview

This prompt guides the assessment of scale diversity across project categories. It ensures appropriate representation of small, medium, and large projects within each category.

## Pre-Assessment Checklist

- [ ] Projects have been selected for each category
- [ ] Project scales have been identified
- [ ] Scale distribution has been analyzed
- [ ] Scale requirements are defined

## Scale Categories

### Small Projects (1-2 per category)

**Characteristics:**
- Personal/side projects
- Individual maintainers
- Simple architectures
- Basic tooling
- Limited scope

**Selection Criteria:**
- [ ] Individual or small team maintainers

- [ ] Basic documentation and tooling
- [ ] Personal or small-scale use cases
- [ ] Limited complexity

**Quality Indicators:**
- [ ] Clear, focused purpose
- [ ] Simple but effective implementation
- [ ] Basic but adequate documentation
- [ ] Personal commitment and maintenance
- [ ] Community interest and adoption

### Medium Projects (1-2 per category)

**Characteristics:**
- Team projects
- Small organizations
- Moderate complexity
- Standard tooling
- Broader scope

**Selection Criteria:**
- [ ] Small team or organization
- [ ] Moderate complexity and scope
- [ ] Standard development practices
- [ ] Community adoption and contribution
- [ ] Professional maintenance

**Quality Indicators:**
- [ ] Well-organized team structure
- [ ] Standard development practices
- [ ] Good documentation and examples
- [ ] Active community engagement
- [ ] Professional maintenance

### Large Projects (1-2 per category)

**Characteristics:**
- Enterprise/community projects
- Large organizations
- Complex architectures
- Advanced tooling
- Broad scope

**Selection Criteria:**
- [ ] Large organization or community
- [ ] Complex architecture and scope
- [ ] Advanced development practices
- [ ] Significant community adoption
- [ ] Professional governance

**Quality Indicators:**
- [ ] Sophisticated architecture
- [ ] Advanced development practices
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Strong community governance
- [ ] Professional maintenance

## Assessment Process

### Step 1: Scale Identification
- Analyze project characteristics
- Identify maintainer structure
- Assess complexity and scope
- Determine scale category

### Step 2: Distribution Analysis
- Count projects by scale within each category
- Identify gaps in scale representation
- Assess balance across scales
- Document scale distribution

### Step 3: Gap Analysis
- Identify missing scales
- Find underrepresented scales
- Locate overrepresented scales
- Assess balance requirements

### Step 4: Adjustment Strategy
- Identify projects to add or replace
- Balance scale representation
- Maintain quality standards
- Document adjustment rationale

## Category-Specific Scale Requirements

## Documentation Requirements

### Scale Distribution Summary
- Scale distribution across categories
- Balance analysis within categories
- Gap identification and recommendations
- Quality standards maintained across scales

### Adjustment Rationale
- Projects to add or replace
- Scale balancing decisions
- Quality impact considerations
- Final scale distribution validation

## Quality Assurance

### Scale Validation
- [ ] Each scale is represented appropriately
- [ ] Quality standards are maintained across scales
- [ ] Scale characteristics are accurate
- [ ] Distribution is balanced

### Category Validation
- [ ] Each category has appropriate scale diversity
- [ ] Category-specific requirements are met
- [ ] Scale representation is meaningful
- [ ] Quality is maintained across scales

This prompt ensures comprehensive scale diversity while maintaining quality standards and meaningful representation across all project categories.
