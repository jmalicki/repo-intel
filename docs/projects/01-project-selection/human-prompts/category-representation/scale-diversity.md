### Large Projects (1-2 per category)

**Characteristics:**
- Enterprise/community projects
- Large organizations
- Complex architectures
- Advanced tooling
- Broad scope

**Selection Criteria:**
- [ ] Large organization or community
- [ ] Complex architecture and scope
- [ ] Advanced development practices
- [ ] Significant community adoption
- [ ] Professional governance

**Quality Indicators:**

- [ ] Strong community governance
- [ ] Professional maintenance

## Assessment Process

### Step 1: Scale Identification
- Analyze project characteristics
- Identify maintainer structure
- Assess complexity and scope
- Determine scale category

### Step 2: Distribution Analysis
- Count projects by scale within each category
- Identify gaps in scale representation
- Assess balance across scales
- Document scale distribution

### Step 3: Gap Analysis
- Identify missing scales
- Find underrepresented scales
- Locate overrepresented scales
- Assess balance requirements

### Step 4: Adjustment Strategy
- Identify projects to add or replace
- Balance scale representation
- Maintain quality standards
- Document adjustment rationale
