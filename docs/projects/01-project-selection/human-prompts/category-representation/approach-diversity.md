## Assessment Process

### Step 1: Pattern Identification
- Analyze architectural patterns
- Identify technology stacks
- Assess organizational models
- Document approach characteristics

### Step 2: Diversity Analysis
- Count approaches within categories
- Identify pattern diversity
- Assess technology stack variety
- Document organizational diversity

### Step 3: Gap Analysis
- Identify missing approaches
- Find underrepresented patterns
- Locate overrepresented approaches
- Assess diversity requirements

### Step 4: Adjustment Strategy
- Identify projects to add or replace
- Balance approach diversity
- Maintain quality standards
- Document adjustment rationale
