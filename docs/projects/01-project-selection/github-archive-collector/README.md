# GitHub Archive Collector

**Parent:** [Projects Overview](../README.md)
**Related:** [Automation Opportunities](../../phases/01-project-selection/AUTOMATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md) - Historical data collection

## Overview

The GitHub Archive Collector is a **Rust application** that collects historical time series data from GitHub Archive (GH Archive) to provide historical trends and patterns for repository analysis. It complements the GitHub API Collector by providing historical data that GitHub's API cannot provide, such as stars over time, activity trends, and historical repository metrics.

**üî¨ FEASIBILITY RESEARCH PENDING üî¨**

This component requires **comprehensive research** before implementation can begin:

- **BigQuery Feasibility**: Determine if GitHub Archive data access is feasible within free tier limits
- **Data Consumption Analysis**: Measure actual data consumption for repository analysis
- **Query Pattern Optimization**: Identify efficient query strategies for time series analysis
- **Cost Implications**: Assess cost implications for different usage scenarios
- **Technical Feasibility**: Validate API integration and data processing requirements

**See [Research Plan](RESEARCH_PLAN.md) for detailed research methodology and timeline.**

**DO NOT START IMPLEMENTATION** until research is completed and feasibility is validated.
