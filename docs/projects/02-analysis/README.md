# Phase 2: Repository Analysis Tools

**Navigation:** [Projects Overview](../README.md) → [Project Selection](../../01-project-selection/AUTOMATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md) → Phase 2 Tools

This directory contains tools for **analyzing** the selected projects to discover patterns and best practices.

## Phase 2 Purpose
**Goal**: Deep analysis of selected projects to discover novel patterns, best practices, and innovative approaches

## What Phase 2 Does
1. **Deep repository analysis** of selected projects
2. **Pattern discovery** across different project types
3. **Best practice identification** within and across categories
4. **Innovation detection** and novel approach discovery

## What Phase 2 Does NOT Do
- Project selection (that's Phase 1)
- Template generation (that's Phase 3)
- Guideline creation (that's Phase 4)

## Tools Needed for Phase 2

### 1. Deep Analysis Tools
- **Pattern Matcher** - Discover novel patterns and practices
- **Code Quality Analyzer** - Analyze code organization and quality
- **Documentation Analyzer** - Analyze documentation approaches
- **CI/CD Analyzer** - Analyze CI/CD and deployment practices

### 2. Cross-Project Analysis Tools
- **Pattern Aggregator** - Aggregate patterns across projects
- **Best Practice Identifier** - Identify common best practices
- **Innovation Detector** - Find novel and innovative approaches
- **Category Comparator** - Compare approaches across categories

### 3. Analysis Reporting Tools
- **Analysis Report Generator** - Generate detailed analysis reports
- **Pattern Documentation** - Document discovered patterns
- **Best Practice Catalog** - Catalog identified best practices

## Output of Phase 2
- **Detailed analysis reports** for each project
- **Pattern catalog** of discovered practices
- **Best practice inventory** across categories
- **Innovation examples** and novel approaches

## Next Phase
Phase 2 feeds into **Phase 3: Templates** where we create template repositories based on discovered patterns.
