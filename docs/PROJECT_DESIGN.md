# Repo Intelligence Project Design

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and understand how different types of software projects organize, structure, and maintain their codebases. The ultimate goal is to create high-quality template repositories for GitHub that serve as best-practice examples for different project types and scales.

## Target Project Categories

We will analyze eight main categories of projects:

1. **Chrome Extensions** - Browser extension projects
2. **MCP Servers** - Model Context Protocol server implementations  
3. **Rust Libraries** - Ranging from small utilities (like parking_lot) to large frameworks (like tokio)
4. **Full-Stack Systems** - Projects with both frontend and backend components (including API-first services)
5. **Data Science & ML Projects** - Machine learning libraries, data science tools, and ML frameworks
6. **CLI Tools & Applications** - Command-line utilities and desktop applications
7. **Mobile Applications** - React Native, Flutter, and native mobile apps
8. **Documentation Sites** - Docusaurus, GitBook, and custom documentation platforms

## Analysis Framework

For each project, we will systematically examine the following aspects:

### 1. Pre-commit Setup
- How pre-commit hooks are configured
- Which tools are integrated (linting, formatting, testing)
- Custom vs. standard configurations

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Structure
- **Job Organization**: Multiple jobs, chaining, platform-specific configurations
- **Trigger Patterns**: PR requirements, manual triggers, scheduled runs
- **Artifact Management**: What artifacts are saved and where
- **Implementation Strategies**: Scripts vs. Docker containers vs. inline commands
- **Tool Ecosystem**: Popular GitHub Actions marketplace usage
- **Performance**: Build times, parallelization strategies

### 3. Codebase Organization
- **Directory Structure**: Top-level organization, package placement
- **Subproject Management**: Subdirectories vs. separate repositories
- **Documentation Placement**: README location, deeper docs structure
- **Multi-language Projects**: How different components are organized

### 4. Release Management
- **Branching Strategy**: Main/develop patterns, feature branch workflows
- **Release Process**: Automated vs. manual, versioning strategies
- **Artifact Distribution**: Where releases are published, what formats
- **Changelog Management**: How changes are documented

### 5. Documentation Strategy
- **README Scope**: What's included vs. external docs
- **Documentation Depth**: API docs, user guides, developer docs
- **Documentation Maintenance**: How docs stay current with code
- **Multi-audience Docs**: Developer vs. user documentation

### 6. Testing Philosophy
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, e2e approaches
- **Test Organization**: How tests are structured and tagged
- **Test Automation**: CI integration, coverage requirements
- **Test Data Management**: Fixtures, mocking strategies

### 7. Contribution Standards
- **Commit Message Standards**: Conventional commits, message templates, validation
- **Pull Request Process**: Templates, review requirements, merge strategies
- **Bug Report Standards**: Issue templates, triage processes, labeling systems
- **Code Review Practices**: Review criteria, approval processes, feedback culture
- **Contribution Guidelines**: How to contribute, coding standards, communication norms

### 8. Security & Compliance
- **Security Practices**: Vulnerability handling, dependency scanning, secrets management
- **Compliance Requirements**: License compliance, export controls, regulatory requirements
- **Security Documentation**: Security policies, vulnerability disclosure processes
- **Dependency Management**: Vulnerable dependency handling, security updates

### 9. Performance & Monitoring
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmarking strategies, performance regression testing
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Logging, metrics, tracing, alerting setup
- **Performance Documentation**: Performance characteristics, optimization guides
- **Resource Management**: Memory usage, CPU optimization, resource limits

### 10. Internationalization & Accessibility
- **i18n Strategy**: Multi-language support, locale handling, translation workflows
- **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG compliance, screen reader support, inclusive design
- **Community Guidelines**: Code of conduct, inclusive language policies
- **Accessibility Testing**: Automated and manual accessibility testing

### 11. Dependency & Licensing
- **Dependency Strategy**: Dependency selection, version management, ecosystem integration
- **License Strategy**: Open source licensing, dual licensing, commercial licensing
- **Legal Documentation**: Terms of service, privacy policies, contributor agreements
- **Compliance Documentation**: Legal requirements, export controls, intellectual property

## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Project Selection
For each category, identify:
- **Leading Projects**: High popularity, active maintenance
- **Quality Exemplars**: Well-regarded for best practices, even if less popular
- **Diverse Examples**: Different scales, approaches, and use cases

Selection criteria will include:
- GitHub stars, forks, and activity
- Community reputation and maintainer quality
- Documentation completeness
- CI/CD sophistication
- Code organization clarity

### Phase 2: Repository Analysis
For each selected project:
- **Automated Analysis**: Script-based extraction of structural patterns
- **Manual Review**: Deep dive into configuration files and practices
- **Community Research**: Understanding project culture and decision-making
- **Historical Analysis**: How practices evolved over time

### Phase 3: Pattern Synthesis
- **Cross-Project Analysis**: Identify common patterns within categories
- **Cross-Category Analysis**: Find universal best practices
- **Scale Analysis**: How practices adapt to project size
- **Technology-Specific Patterns**: Language and framework-specific approaches

## Deliverables

### Individual Project Reports
Each analyzed project will receive a comprehensive report covering:
- Executive summary of organizational approach
- Detailed breakdown of each analysis dimension
- Strengths and potential improvements
- Unique or innovative practices
- Community and maintenance insights

### Template Repository Recommendations
Based on analysis, propose template repository structures for:
- **Starter Templates**: Minimal viable setups for each project type
- **Advanced Templates**: Feature-rich templates with comprehensive tooling
- **Scale-Specific Templates**: Different templates for different project sizes
- **Technology-Specific Templates**: Language and framework-specific variations

### Best Practice Guidelines
- **Universal Practices**: Applicable across all project types
- **Category-Specific Guidelines**: Tailored recommendations for each project type
- **Scale Guidelines**: How to adapt practices as projects grow
- **Tool Recommendations**: Curated lists of recommended tools and configurations

## Success Metrics

- **Template Adoption**: Usage of generated templates in new projects
- **Community Feedback**: Validation from project maintainers and contributors
- **Quality Improvement**: Measurable improvements in project organization
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Successful application of patterns across different project types
