# Human Prompts for Phase 1: Project Selection

**Parent:** [Projects Overview](../../../projects/01-project-selection/README.md)
**Related:** [Automation Opportunities](../../../phases/01-project-selection/AUTOMATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md) - Human judgment tasks

## Overview

This directory contains carefully designed prompts for the human judgment tasks in Phase 1 that cannot be automated. Each prompt is organized in its own directory for focused, discrete guidance.

## Human Judgment Tasks

Based on [AUTOMATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md](../../../phases/01-project-selection/AUTOMATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md), the following tasks require human judgment:

### 1. Project Selection and Ranking
**Task:** Final project selection and ranking decisions
**Automation Potential:** 0% - Requires human judgment
**Prompt:** [Project Selection and Ranking](project-selection-ranking/README.md)

### 2. Category Representation Assessment
**Task:** Ensure appropriate category coverage and diversity
**Automation Potential:** 0% - Requires human judgment
**Prompt:** [Category Representation](category-representation/README.md)

### 3. Final Quality Assessment
**Task:** Final quality decisions and threshold application
**Automation Potential:** 0% - Requires human judgment
**Prompt:** [Final Quality Assessment](final-quality-assessment/README.md)

## Shared Process Support Prompts

These prompts support all human judgment tasks:

### 4. Pre-Assessment Checklist
**Purpose:** Ensure all necessary data and preparations are complete
**Focus:** Data collection, team preparation, process readiness
**Prompt:** [Pre-Assessment Checklist](pre-assessment-checklist.md)

### 5. Quality Assurance
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent, high-quality decisions throughout the process
**Focus:** Cross-validation, documentation quality, process consistency
**Prompt:** [Quality Assurance](quality-assurance.md)

### 6. Documentation Requirements
**Purpose:** Define comprehensive documentation requirements
**Focus:** Assessment documentation, decision documentation, process documentation
**Prompt:** [Documentation Requirements](documentation-requirements.md)

## Prompt Design Principles

### 1. **Clear Structure**
- Specific questions with clear criteria
- Structured evaluation frameworks
- Consistent scoring methodologies

### 2. **Efficiency Focus**
- Minimize redundant questions
- Focus on high-value judgments
- Leverage automated data where possible

### 3. **Quality Assurance**
- Built-in validation checks
- Cross-reference with automated metrics
- Clear decision criteria

### 4. **Documentation**
- Capture reasoning for decisions
- Document selection rationale
- Enable handoff to Phase 2

## Usage Workflow

### Step 1: Automated Data Collection
- Run all automation tools to collect quantitative data
- Generate metrics reports and candidate lists
- Prepare data for human review

### Step 2: Human Judgment Tasks
- Use prompts to guide qualitative assessment
- Apply human judgment to final decisions
- Document reasoning and rationale

### Step 3: Final Selection
- Combine automated metrics with human judgment
- Generate final project shortlist
- Prepare handoff documentation

## Expected Outcomes

- **Consistent Evaluation**: Standardized approach to human judgment tasks
- **Quality Decisions**: Well-reasoned selection and ranking decisions
- **Documentation**: Clear rationale for all decisions
- **Efficiency**: Focused prompts that minimize time while maximizing quality

This approach ensures that human intelligence is focused on the most critical judgment tasks while leveraging automation for mechanistic data collection and analysis.
