# Project Selection Methodology

**Parent:** [Project Design](../../docs/PROJECT_DESIGN.md)

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic approach for selecting representative projects within each of our 8 categories for comprehensive analysis. The goal is to identify projects that exemplify best practices while representing different scales, approaches, and community dynamics.

## Selection Strategy
