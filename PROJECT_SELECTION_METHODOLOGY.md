# Project Selection Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic approach for selecting representative projects within each of our 8 categories for comprehensive analysis. The goal is to identify projects that exemplify best practices while representing different scales, approaches, and community dynamics.

## Selection Strategy

- **Mix of scales**: 1 small, 1-2 medium, 1-2 large projects per category
- **Mix of approaches**: Different organizational and architectural patterns
- **Quality exemplars**: Projects known for specific best practices
- **Popular projects**: High-usage projects with proven track records

## Selection Timeline

### Week 1: Initial Research
- Compile comprehensive candidate lists for each category
- Gather quantitative metrics for all candidates
- Identify category-specific evaluation criteria

### Week 2: Deep Evaluation
- Manual review of top candidates
- Community health assessment
- Documentation and code quality evaluation
- Security and performance analysis

### Week 3: Final Selection
- Apply diversity requirements
- Cross-category pattern analysis
- Final shortlist compilation
- Selection rationale documentation

## Documentation Requirements

For each selected project, document:
- **Selection Rationale**: Why this project was chosen
- **Key Strengths**: What makes this project exemplary
- **Unique Practices**: Innovative or distinctive approaches
- **Scale Context**: How project size affects practices
- **Community Insights**: Governance and contribution patterns

## Success Metrics

- **Representative Coverage**: All major patterns within each category represented
- **Quality Assurance**: All selected projects meet minimum quality thresholds
